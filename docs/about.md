# About _cogito ex machina_

## Who's behind this?

I'm David Morgan, I live in the UK and have interests in Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Philosophy, especially the Philosophy of Mind and the Problem of Consciousness, which is all sharpened by the prospect of an upcoming [Singularity or Intelligence Explosion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity).

I obtained my BA in Philosophy and Literature from Warwick University and my professional career has been in Information Technology, as a programmer, business analyst and product manager.

Philosophical labels can be difficult things, and I don't know yet what I really think about these issues, but I can say that I'm _not_ a [Cartesian Dualist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind%E2%80%93body_dualism) and also that I see the emergence of machine intelligence and even machine consciousness as possible in principle.

## What does the name _cogito ex machina_ mean?

For me it means 'thinking from a machine'.

The words are Latin, although the phrase itself may not be grammatically-correct Latin. 

_cogito_ indicates _thinking or reasoning_, as in Descartes' famous conclusion: _cogito ergo sum_, which is generally translated as _I think therefore I am_.

_ex machina_ indicates _from the machine_. It is the title of a beautiful film that explores themes of intelligence, consciousness and human values in robots. It's also a fragment from the Latin phrase _deus ex machina_, literally 'a god from the machine', which can be used in philosophy to refer to something metaphysical or outside the world of cause and effect, but _ex machina_ here doesn't imply _dualism_, rather it echoes Gilbert Ryle's dismissal of dualism as imagining a 'ghost in the machine'.

So in the end the site name _cogito ex machina_  is just a mash-up, snagging several strands of philosophy and culture.
