# _cogito ex machina_

My investigations into Artificial General Intelligence and related topics, especially philosophical questions about the limits of machine intelligence and the consequences of a possible intelligence explosion. 

_cogito ex machina_ has two main sections:

* Opinion, contains my own thoughts on various AI topics &ndash; an occasional blog of sorts
* Research, which contains reviews and critiques of books, articles and videos.

### Welcome to _cogito ex machina_

_30th December 2018_

The Opinion section is a blog of sorts, sharing provisional conclusions arising from my study and putting forward some of my own opinions. There is nothing much here yet because I wanted to get the piece about Steven Pinker's mistaken argument out quickly, but there is much more being worked on and that will follow later.
