### Coherent arguments about the existential risk of Artificial Intelligence

In an [October 2018 interview](https://youtu.be/epQxfSp-rdU?t=1) the Harvard academic and author Steven Pinker said that:

* he finds arguments about the existential threat of AI to be [incoherent](https://youtu.be/epQxfSp-rdU?t=671)
* and that we should 'trust the engineers'.

When asked about a [tweet by Elon Musk](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/968560525088055296?lang=en) about the difference between narrow AI and AGI, Steven Pinker waved it away, implied that Elon Musk is a hot-head and said that this was not the last time that ["Elon Musk has fired off an intemperate tweet"](https://youtu.be/epQxfSp-rdU?t=659).

Although that may be true, it doesn't prove Pinker's point about AI not being worth spending too much time worrying about, so this short animated video examines Pinker's assertions, coolly.
